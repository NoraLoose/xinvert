# Statement of need

Many problems in meteorology and oceanography can be cast into a balanced model in the form of a partial differential equation (PDE).  The most well-known one is the relation between the streamfunction $\psi$ and the vertical vorticity $\zeta$ (also known as Poisson equation):

$$\nabla^2 \psi = \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial y^2}+\frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial y^2} = \zeta$$

Once $\zeta$ is given as a known, one needs to get the unknown $\psi$ with proper boundary conditions, which is essentially an inversion problem (\autoref{fig:1}).  Many geophysical fluid dynamical (GFD) problems can be described by such a balanced model, which is generally of second (or fourth) order in spatial derivatives and do not depend explicitly on time.  Therefore, it is also known as a steady-state model.  Early scientists tried to find analytical solutions by simplified the parameters of these models (e.g., assuming constant coefficients).  Nowadays, with the new developments in numerical algorithms and parallel-computing programming, one may need a modern solver, written in a popular programming language like `Python`, to invert all these models in a numerical fashion.  More specifically, the following needs should be satisfied:

- **A unified numerical solver:** It can solve all the classical balanced GFD models, even in a domain with irregular boundaries like the ocean.  New models can also be adapted straightforwardly to fit the solver;
- **Thinking and coding in equations:** Users focus naturally on the key inputs and outputs of the GFD models, just like thinking of the knowns and unknowns of the PDEs;
- **Flexible parameter specification:** Coefficients of the models can be either constant, 1D vector, or ND array.  This allows an easy reproduce of early simplified results and also an extension to more general/realistic results;
- **Fast and efficient:** The algorithm should be fast and efficient.  Also, the codes can be compiled first and then executed as fast as `C` or `FORTRAN`, instead of executed in the slow pure `Python` interpreter.  In addition, it can leverage the multi-core and out-of-core computational capabilities of modern computers;

`xinvert` is then designed to satisfy all the above needs, based on the ecosystem of `Python`.

# Mathematics

This package, `xinvert`, is designed to invert or solve the following PDE in an abstract form:

$$L\left(\psi \right) = F  \label{eq:1} \tag{1}$$

where $L$ is a second-order partial differential operator, $\psi$ the unknown to be inverted for, and $F$ a prescribed forcing function.  There could be also some coefficients or parameters in the definition of $L$, which should be specified before inverting $\psi$.

For the 2D case, the **general form** of Eq. \eqref{eq:1} is:

$$L\left(\psi\right) \equiv A_1\frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial y^2}+A_2\frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial y \partial x}+A_3\frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial x^2}+A_4\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial y}+A_5\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x}+A_6\psi = F \label{eq:2} \tag{2}$$

where coefficients $A_1-A_6$ are all known variables.  When the condition $4A_1 A_3-A_2^2>0$ is met everywhere in the domain, the above equation is an elliptic-type equation.  In this case, one can invert $\psi$ using the **successive over relaxation (SOR)** iteration method.  When $4A_1 A_3-A_2^2=0$ or $4A_1 A_3-A_2^2<0$, it is a parabolic or hyperbolic equation.  In either case, SOR would *fail* to converge to the solution.

Sometimes the **general form** of Eq. \eqref{eq:2} can be transformed into the **standard form** (i.e., standarization):

$$L\left(\psi\right) \equiv \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(A_1\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial y}+A_2\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x}\right)+\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(A_3\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial y}+A_4\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x}\right) + A_5\psi = F \label{eq:3} \tag{3}$$

In this case, $A_1 A_4-A_2 A_3>0$ should be met to insure its ellipticity.  The elliptic condition has its own physical meaning in the problems of interest.  That is, the system is in a steady (or balanced) state that is stable to any small perturbation.

Many problems in meteorology and oceanography can be cast into the forms of either Eq. \eqref{eq:2} or Eq. \eqref{eq:3}.  However, some of them are formulated in 3D case (like the QG-omega equation):

$$L\left(\psi\right) \equiv \frac{\partial}{\partial z}\left(A_1\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial z}\right) +\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(A_2\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial y}\right) +\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(A_3\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x}\right) = F \label{eq:4} \tag{4}$$

or in **fourth-order** case (the Munk model):

$$
\begin{aligned}
L\left(\psi\right) &\equiv A_1\frac{\partial^4 \psi}{\partial y^4}+A_2\frac{\partial^4 \psi}{\partial y^2 \partial x^2}+A_3\frac{\partial^4 \psi}{\partial x^4} \notag\\
&+A_4\frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial y^2}+A_5\frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial y \partial x}+A_6\frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial x^2}+A_7\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial y}+A_8\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x}+A_9\psi = F \label{eq:5}
\end{aligned} \tag{5}
$$

So we implement four basic solvers to take into account the above four Eqs. \eqref{eq:2}-\eqref{eq:5} cases.  Most of the problems fit one of these four types of solver.  However, it is **NOT** clear which form, the genral form Eq. \eqref{eq:2} or the standard form Eq. \eqref{eq:3}, is preferred for the inversion if a problem can be cast into either one.


# Summary

`xinvert` is an open-source and uesr-friendly `Python` package that enables GFD scientists or interested amateurs to solve all possible GFD problems in a numerical fashion.  With the ecosystem of open-source `Python` packages, in particular `xarray` [@Hoyer:2017], `dask` [@Rocklin:2015], and `numba` [@Lam:2015], it is able to satisfy the above requirements:

- All the classical balanced GFD models can be inverted by this unified numerical solver;
- User APIs (\autoref{table:1}) are very close to the equations: unknowns are on the left-hand side of the equal sign `=`, whereas the known forcing functions are on its right-hand side (other known coefficients are also on the left-hand side but are passed in through `mParams`);
- Passing a single `xarray.DataArray` is usually enough for the inversion. Coordinates information is already encapsulated and thus reducing the length of the parameter list.  In addition, paramters in `mParams` can be either a constant, or varying with a specific dimension (like Coriolis parameter $f$), or fully varying with space and time, due to the use of `xarray`'s [@Hoyer:2017] broadcasting capability;
- This package leverages `numba` [@Lam:2015] and `dask` [@Rocklin:2015] to support Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, multi-core, and out-of-core computations, and therefore greatly increases the speed and efficiency of the inversion.

Here we summarize the inversion problems in meteorology and oceanography into \autoref{table:1}.  The table can be extended further if one finds more problems that fit the abstract form of Eq. \eqref{eq:1}.

# Usage

`xinvert` is designed in a functional-programming (FP) style.  Users only need to import the function they are interested in and call it to get the inverted results (\autoref{table:1}).  Note that the calculation of the forcing function $F$ (e.g., calculating the vorticity using velocity vector) on the right-hand side of the equation is **NOT** the core part of this package.  But there is a `FiniteDiff` utility module with which finite difference calculus can be readily performed.
